A program that performs a Euclidean distance transform operation on a binary text file. The text file must begin with a header that displays: the number of rows, the number of columns, the minimum value, and the maximum value.

Example compilation and run:

`javac EuclideanDistanceTransform.java`

`java EuclideanDistanceTransfrom example_input.txt output.txt debugging.txt`
